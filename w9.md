Relational Design Theory	Database Systems

Notation: in the relational schemas below, primary key attributes are underlined (e.g. pk), foreign key attributes are shown in italic font (e.g. fk) and primary key attributes that are also foreign keys are underlined and in italic font (e.g. pk+fk).

Example:
Student(id, name, degreeCode)
Degree(code, name, requirements)
Subject(code, name, syllabus)
Marks(studentId, subjectCode, teachingTerm, mark)
In their respective relations, the student id, the degree code and the subject code are primary keys. In the Student relation, the degree code is a foreign key. In the Marks relation, the three attributes student id, subject code and teaching term together form the primary key; the first two (student id and subject code) are also foreign keys.

Functional dependencies.
> Functional dependencies: a variable that determines other variables A -> B

> Closure: The set of attributes X, X^+ are all the attributes that X can determine from a set fo FDs

> Candidate Key: The smallest set of attributes that I can determine every element of a set

> If it is BCNF it is also 3NF
> For something to be BCNF Every FDs LHS->RHS must satisfy at least one of:
> 1. Trivial FD where RHS is a subest of LHS (e.g. ABC->B, AB->AB)
> 2. The LHS is a superkey which cand etermine all other attributes. The LHS contains candidate key ()
> If it is BCNF it is also 3NF if it isnt BCNF then we can check one more condition for 3NF:
> 3. Is the RHS a single attribute and part of a candidate key?

> To decompose a schema into 3NF
> 1. Compute the minimal cover
> 2. Flatten FDs to make relations/tables in a db schema
> 3. Add the candidate key as a relation if the existing relations aren't full cover.

>Minimal Cover 
> Mainly for 3NF decomposition its F_c - a more optimal set of FDs. Remove redundancies. To compute:
> 1. Make every FD into canonical form X->A where A is a single attribute
> 2. Remove redunt ones from LHS using canddiate keys
> 3. Remove all redundant FDs using transitive property A->B B->C then A->C

> To decompose into BCNF
> 1. Calculate candidate keys
> 2. Go through all the FDs if LHS->RHS is not BCNF then split the relation into two:
> S=LHS+ with the FDs use find that closure
> T=R-LHS^+ + LHS with all the FDs that don't change from removed attributes


##### 1a What functional dependencies are implied if we know that a set of attributes X is a candidate key for a relation R?



##### 1b What functional dependencies can we infer do not hold by inspection of the following relation?

A	B	C
a	1	x
b	2	y
c	1	z
d	2	x
a	1	y
b	2	z
Suppose that we have a relation schema R(A,B,C) representing a relationship between two entity sets E and F with keys A and B respectively, and suppose that R has (at least) the functional dependencies A → B and B → A. Explain what this tells us about the relationship between E and F.

##### 2 Consider the relation R(A,B,C,D,E,F,G) and the set of functional dependencies F = { A → B, BC → F, BD → EG, AD → C, D → F, BEG → FA } compute the following:

A+

*AB*

ACEG+

*ABCEFG*

BD+

*ABCDEFG*

##### 3 Consider the relation R(A,B,C,D,E) and the set set of functional dependencies F = { A → B, BC → E, ED → A }

List all of the candidate keys for R.

Is R in third normal form (3NF)?

Is R in Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)?

#### 4 Consider a relation R(A,B,C,D). For each of the following sets of functional dependencies, assuming that those are the only dependencies that hold for R, do the following:

List all of the candidate keys for R.



Show whether R is in Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)?

Show whether R is in third normal form (3NF)?

C → D,   C → A,   B → C

*a  B*
*Check BCNF C->D (not 3NF as RHS is not a candidate key)
C-> A 
B-> C*

B → C,   D → A

*BD*
*not 3nf .. neither rhs is part of a key*
*not bcnf neither lhs contains a key*
ABC → D,   D → A

*ABC, BCD*
*3NF it is in*
*not BCNF*


A → B,   BC → D,   A → C

*A*
*not either*

AB → C,   AB → D,   C → A,   D → B

*AB, CD, BC, BD*
*3NF yes, BCNF no C->A doesnt have a key*
A → BCD

*A*
*3NF and BCNF*

#### 5 Specify the non-trivial functional dependencies for each of the relations in the following Teams-Players-Fans schema and then show whether the overall schema is in BCNF.

Team(name, captain)
Player(name, teamPlayedFor)
Fan(name, address)
TeamColours(teamName, colour)
FavouriteColours(fanName, colour)
FavouritePlayers(fanName, playerName)
FavouriteTeams(fanName, teamName)

#### 6 Specify the non-trivial functional dependencies for each of the relations in the following Trucks-Shipments-Stores schema and then show whether the overall schema is in BCNF.

Warehouse(warehouse#, address)
Source(trip, warehouse)
Trip(trip#, date, truck)
Truck(truck#, maxvol, maxwt)
Shipment(shipment#, volume, weight, trip, store)
Store(store#, storename, address)

#### 7 For each of the sets of dependencies in question 4:

if R is not already in 3NF, decompose it into a set of 3NF relations

if R is not already in BCNF, decompose it into a set of BCNF relations

C → D,   C → A,   B → C
*CK is B so C->D violates BCNF C^+=ACD from C->D and C->A and key C*
*S= C^+=ACD with FDs C->D and C->A and key C*
*T = ABCD-ACD+C=BC with FD B->C and key B*

C->AD B->C

B → C,   D → A
*CK is BD. B->C violates BCNF so
*S1=B^+=BC wiuth FD B->C , key B*
*S2=ABCD-BC+B=ABD with FD D->A key BD*
*ABD -> BD AD fo sinal result is BC, BD, AD*

ABC → D,   D → A

*CKs were ABC and BCD D->A violates BCNF*
*D^+=DA so*
*S1=DA with FD D->A key D*
*S2 = ABCD-DA+D=BCD with no FDs key is BCD*
*both tables in BCNF*

A → B,   BC → D,   A → C

*A was the CK BC->D violates BC^+=BCD*
*S1=BCD with the key BC and FD BC->D*
*ABCD-BCD+BC= ABC and FDs are A->B A->C key A*

AB → C,   AB → D,   C → A,   D → B
*CKs AB, CD, AD, BC C->A violates BCNF so split on this one*
*S1=C^+=AC C->A key C*
*S2=ABCD-AC+C=BCD keys BC,CD FD D->B*
*split again as D->B not BCNF*
*S3=DB with FD D->B key D*
*S4=BCD-DB+D=CD no FDs key CD*

A → BCD

#### 8 Consider (yet another) banking application that contains information about accounts, branches and customers. Each account is held at a specific branch, but a customer may hold more than one account and an account may have more than one associated customer.

Consider an unnormalised relation containing all of the attributes that are relevant to this application:

acct# - unique account indentifier
branch# - unique branch identifier
tfn - unique customer identifier (tax file number)
kind - type of account (savings, cheque, ...)
balance - amount of money in account
city - city where branch is located
name - customer's name
i.e. consider the relation R(acct#, branch#, tfn, kind, balance, city, name)

Based on the above description:

Devise a suitable set of functional dependencies among these attributes.

Using these functional dependencies, decompose R into a set of 3NF relations.

State whether the new relations are also in BCNF.

#### 9 Consider a schema representing projects within a company, containing the following information:

pNum - project's unique identifying number
pName - name of project
eNum - employee's unique identifying number
eName - name of employee
jobClass - type of job that employee has on this project
payRate - hourly rate, dependent on the kind of job being done
hours - total hours worked in this job by this employee
This schema started out life as a large spreadsheet and now the company wants to put it into a database system.

As a spreadsheet, its schema is: R(pNum, pName, eNum, eName, jobClass, payRate, hours)

Based on the above description:

Devise a suitable set of functional dependencies among these attributes.
Using these functional dependencies, decompose R into a set of BCNF relations.
State whether the new relations are also in 3NF.

#### 10 Real estate agents conduct visits to rental properties need to record which property, who went, when, results each property is assigned a unique code (P#, e.g. PG4) each staff member has a staff number (S#, e.g. SG43) staff members use company cars to conduct visits a visit occurs at a specific time on a given day notes are made on the state of the property after each visit The company stores all of the associated data in a spreadsheet. Describe any functional dependencies that exist in this data. The table of sample data below below may give some ideas:

P#  | When        | Address    | Notes         | S#   | Name  | CarReg
